    <h2>CRITICAL RECEPTION</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    Dune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966, and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.
    Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book
    ever written. The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies. Dune has been
    regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.

    Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as "unique" and wrote, "I know nothing comparable to it except Lord of the Rings."
    Robert A. Heinlein described the novel as "powerful, convincing, and most ingenious." It was described as "one of
    the monuments of modern science fiction" by the Chicago Tribune, and P. Schuyler Miller called Dune "one of the
    landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation." The Washington Post described it as "a
    portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed
    ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon."
    Algis Budrys praised Dune for the vividness of its imagined setting, saying "The time lives. It breathes, it speaks,
    and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils". He found that the novel, however, "turns flat and tails off at the end.
    ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before
    this new Messiah". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent
    emotional impact, saying "you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek". After criticizing
    unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune as among stories "that are so tautly constructed, so rich in
    the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical".

    The Louisville Times wrote, "Herbert's creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology,
    religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction."[59] Writing
    for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praises Herbert's "clever authorial decision" to exclude robots and computers ("two staples
    of the genre") from his fictional universe, but suggests that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks "true fandom among
    science-fiction fans" to the extent that it "has not penetrated popular culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and
    Star Wars have". Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story "crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels.
    All its rich elements are in balance and plausibleâ€”not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and
    meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels."

    On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Dune on its list of the 100 most influential novels.
