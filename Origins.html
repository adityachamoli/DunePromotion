    <h2>ORIGINS</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    After his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes. Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes.
    Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways." Herbert's article on the dunes, "They Stopped the Moving Sands", was never completed (and only published
    decades later in The Road to Dune) but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.

    Herbert was also interested in the idea of the superhero mystique and messiahs. He believed that feudalism was a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders.
    He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was
    influenced by the story of T. E. Lawrence and the “messianic overtones” in Lawrence’s involvement in the Arab Revolt. In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too
    straightforward and added more layers to his story.

    Another significant source of inspiration for Dune was Herbert's experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to mycologist Paul Stamets's account.

    Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serial Dune World in the monthly Analog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not
    published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-part The Prophet of Dune in the January – May 1965 issues. The first serial became "Book 1: Dune" in the final published Dune novel, and the second serial
    was divided into "Book Two: Muad'dib" and "Book Three: The Prophet". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, Dune, was finally accepted and published
    in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.

    Herbert dedicated his work "to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."
